# Introduction

*But current version of this document (in English) is not up to date due to my time limitation. For the current functionality of the package, please consult the manual of the `partial.plot` package in R. I hope I will update this document near future so please be patient. I'm sorry for your inconvenience*

This package provides tools for visualizing a result of multivariate analyses.
The goal of this package is providing a easy-to-use method to visualize results of many kinds of regression models.
This package is still in development and may have bugs which can affect your interpretation of the results.
Also I'm still designing the interface of the package so future version may lose some functionality in current version.
If you find bugs or if you have any requests, please let me know by [GitHub](https://github.com/Marchen/partial.plot) or email: paste following code into R to get my address: rawToChar(as.raw(c(109, 111, 103, 64, 102, 102, 112, 114, 105, 46, 97, 102, 102, 114, 99, 46, 103, 111, 46, 106, 112))).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Installation

To install the package, just copy & paste following commands into the R console.

```{R, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
install.packages(
    c("model.adapter", "partial.plot"), type = "source",
    repos = c(
        "http://florivory.net/R/repos", options()$repos
    )
)
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick start (for R wizards)

Try this one! You can also see the [examples](visual.test.html).

```{R, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(partial.plot)
```

```{R}
# Load dataset.
data(iris)

# Create a prediction model by GLM.
model <- glm(
    Petal.Length ~ (Sepal.Length + Petal.Width) * Species, data = iris
)

# Load the library.
library(partial.plot)

# Draw relationship between sepal length and petal length.
info <- partial.plot(model, c("Sepal.Length", "Species"), pch = 16)

# Add a legend.
pp.legend(info, "topleft")

# Draw 3D plot.
info <- partial.plot(
    model, c("Sepal.Length", "Petal.Width"), col = terrain.colors,
    theta = 20
)
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Quick start guild (for normal users)

## Preparing dataset and an example model

In this time, we use the Fisher's iris dataset.
This dataset having petal length (Petal.Length), petal width (Petal.Width),
sepal length (Sepal.Length) and sepal width (Sepal.Width) data of 3 species of
Iris (setosa, versicolor, and virginica).

We can load the dataset and see structure of the data set by following code.

```{R}
# Load the dataset.
data(iris)

# See the structure of the dataset.
str(iris)

# Visualize data.
par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(
    Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length, data = iris,
    pch = as.numeric(Species) + 14, col = as.numeric(Species) + 1
)
plot(
    Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, data = iris,
    pch = as.numeric(Species) + 14, col = as.numeric(Species) + 1
)
plot(
    Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris,
    pch = as.numeric(Species) + 14, col = as.numeric(Species) + 1
)
```

In this guide, we will make a model to predict petal length by other variables.
For the modeling, we are going to use generalized linear model (GLM).
For explanatory variables of the model we will use sepal length, petal width
and species.
By including interaction terms between sepal length and species, and between
petal width and species, we assume that relationships between sepal length and
petal length and between petal width and petal length differ between species.

```{R}
# Make prediction model.
model <- glm(
    Petal.Length ~ (Sepal.Length + Petal.Width) * Species, data = iris
)

# Show summary of the model.
summary(model)
```

## Visualize prediction model

Now we are going to visualize the result of the GLM analysis with
`partial.plot()`. Basic usage of `partial.plot()` function is as follow.
The example below visualize predicted relationship between sepal length and
petal length of the three species.

```{R}
# Load library.
library(partial.plot)

# Visualize predicted relationship between sepal length and petal length.
partial.plot(model, c("Sepal.Length", "Species"), pch = 16)
```

The first argument of the `partial.plot()` is model object returned by a
model function.
In this case we used `model` object returned by `glm()`.

The second argument is a character vector specifying names of explanatory
variables whose relationships to response variable are visualized.
In the example, `"Sepal.Length"` and `"Species"` are specified.
For this argument, multiple names of factors can be specified.
Those two arguments must be specified.

In addition to the above arguments, we put `pch = 16` to make the graph
a bit pretty.

If we want to visualize relationship between petal width and petal length,
we can specify the arguments as follow.

```{R}
# Visualize predicted relationship between petal width and petal length.
partial.plot(model, c("Petal.Width", "Species"), pch = 16)
```

## Adding legend

`partial.plot()` returns information can be used to produce its legend.
For example, if we write following command, information about the plot
is stored in the `info` variable.

```{R, eval = FALSE}
# Store settings of partial.plot into info.
info <- partial.plot(model, c("Sepal.Length", "Species"), pch = 16)
```

By passing `info` to `pp.legend()` function, we can draw a legend using
settings used for `partial.plot()`.

```{R}
# Add legend.
info <- partial.plot(model, c("Sepal.Length", "Species"), pch = 16)
pp.legend(info, "topleft")
```

The usage of `pp.legend` function is almost similar to the `legend` function.
The first argument is result of `partial.plot`, and other arguments are passed
to `legend` function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Visualizing slightly complicated models

`partial.plot()` can visualize more complicated models.
In this time, we use `CO2` dataset in `dataset` package of R.
THis dataset having CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation rate of plants collected
from Quebec and Mississippi in several CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations
after the chilling experiment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Controlling elements of graph

We can control some parameters of `partial.plot` to change appearance of the
graph.

### Removing elements

We can suppress drawing symbols representing residuals by setting `FALSE`
to `draw.residual` argument.

```{R}
partial.plot(
    model, c("Sepal.Length", "Species"), draw.residual = FALSE
)
```

Also, we can suppress drawing predicted partial relationship by specifying
`FALSE` to `draw.relationship` argument.

```{R}
partial.plot(
    model, c("Sepal.Length", "Species"), draw.relationship = FALSE,
    pch = 16
)
```

By setting 'extrapolate' to 'TRUE', predicted partial relationships are drawn
for range of the explanatory variable for all groups.

```{R}
info <- partial.plot(
    model, c("Sepal.Length", "Species"), pch = 16, extrapolate = TRUE
)
pp.legend(info, "topleft")
```

### Changing colors

We can change colors of the graph by several ways.
First way to change colors of the graph is passing `rainbow()` or
`heat.colors()` functions for `col` argument of `partial.plot()`.
We can use functions that described in help page of `rainbow()` function
(type `?rainbow` to see the list).

```{R}
# Change colors of the graph.
info <- partial.plot(
    model, c("Sepal.Length", "Species"), pch = 16, col = rainbow
)
# Colors in the legend is automatically adjusted.
pp.legend(info, "topleft")
```

Second way to change colors is prepare named character vector denoting colors
for each factor levels and specify it for `col` argument.

```{R}
# Prepare a named color vector.
col <- c(
    setosa = "darkgreen", versicolor = "blue", virginica = "orange2"
)
# Specify the vector for col argument.
info <- partial.plot(
    model, c("Sepal.Length", "Species"), pch = 16, col = col
)
pp.legend(info, "topleft")
```

### Other settings

We can change other graphic parameters like `plot` function.
We changed `pch` to set symbol of the in the example above.
But we also use other graphic parameters.

```{R}
# Set other graphic parameters
info <- partial.plot(
    model, c("Sepal.Length", "Species"), pch = 16, cex = 1.5,
    xlab = "Sepal length (mm)", ylab = "Petal Length"
)
pp.legend(info, "topleft")
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Supported models

At this moment, (maybe) `lm()`, `glm()`, `glm.nb()`, `lme()`, `lmer()`, `glmer()`, `glmer.nb()`, `glmmadmb()`, `MCMCglmm()`, `cforest()`, `ctree()`, `svm()`, `randomForest()`, `ranger()`, `rpart()`, `tree()` are supported.
Support for the models are provided by the `model.adapter` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Known issues

* Drawing for only one continuous variable is supported.
Two explanatory variables will be supported in future.

* At least one continuous variable should be specified.
Plotting only by factors will be supported in future.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Other functions

`partial.plot` package contains some functions which may be useful.

## color.ramp()

`color.ramp` function creates color vector from factors.

```{R}
library(partial.plot)
plot(
    Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length, col = color.ramp(Species),
    data = iris, pch = 16
)
```

By similar way to control colors of `partial.plot`, we can change colors
produced by `color.ramp`.

```{R}
plot(
    Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length, col = color.ramp(Species, rainbow),
    data = iris, pch = 16
)
```

```{R}
col <- c(
    setosa = "darkgreen", versicolor = "blue", virginica = "orange2"
)
plot(
    Petal.Length ~ Sepal.Length, col = color.ramp(Species, col),
    data = iris, pch = 16
)
```

## gg.colors()

`gg.colors` creates gg.plot like colors.

```{R}
barplot(1:10, col = gg.colors(10))
```
